# notesapp

This project will be similar to the Windows "Sticky Notes" app, where users are able to:
    Add notes,
    Delete notes,
    Save notes to local storage (currently bugged, looking into a fix),
    Toggle dark mode,
    Search for notes,

    RECENTLY ADDED:
    Counter for notes,
    Hotkey for note saving (ctrl + enter, added ctrl so that notes could still have newlines if desired.)

    TODO:
    Add edit feature.

all with a dynamic frontend and user interface.

This application was made using React and CSS.

From this project I learned the importance of parent-child relationships and keeping the state organized.
